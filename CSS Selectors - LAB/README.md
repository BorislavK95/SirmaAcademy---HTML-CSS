CSS Selectors Exercises

This repository contains various exercises I've completed to practice the core CSS selectors. The goal is to demonstrate my understanding and proficiency with these selectors through hands-on examples and code.

Description

In this repository, I've worked on a series of exercises to practice the following basic CSS selectors:

Element Selectors
Class Selectors
ID Selectors
Attribute Selectors
Pseudo-classes
Pseudo-elements
Combinators (e.g., descendant, child, adjacent sibling, general sibling)
Each exercise focuses on a specific type of selector and how it can be applied to style HTML elements.
